The program works as expected for all tests in the tests folder.

Extra features:

You can tell if either of the modes are enabled based on the button colors.

Trip Mode (t-key on keyboard or 'T' button):
	More fun if you see for yourself.

Insert Trip Mode (no keyboard input, ’I’ button):
	IF YOU ARE PRONE TO SEIZURES PROBABLY NOT A GOOD IDEA TO CLICK IT.
	This button only appears when trip mode is enabled. 
	It will rapidly randomly insert segments into the quad-tree.
	Works best with animation mode on.
